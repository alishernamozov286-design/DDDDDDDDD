.# ðŸ‘¥ User Type Based Content Implementation

This document explains how the Elite Barbershop website shows different content based on user type.

## ðŸŽ¯ Requirement

- **Clients (Mijozlar)**: Should see the booking form to make new appointments
- **Workers (Ishchilar)**: Should see the booking list to view existing appointments

## ðŸ”§ Implementation

### 1. User Type Detection

The system detects user type from localStorage:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const storedUserType = localStorage.getItem('userType');
  if (storedUserType) {
    setUserType(storedUserType);
  }
}, []);
```

### 2. Conditional Content Rendering

The booking section now shows different components based on user type:

```jsx
<SectionWrapper id="booking">
  {userType === 'client' ? <BookingForm /> : <BookingList />}
</SectionWrapper>
```

### 3. User Type Selection

Users select their type on the welcome page:
- **Client**: Selects "Mijozlar" card
- **Worker**: Selects "Ishchilar" card

### 4. Login Process

The login process stores the user type:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('userType', type);
```

## ðŸ“± User Experience

### For Clients (Mijozlar)
- See booking form in the "Bronlar" section
- Can create new appointments
- View focused on making bookings

### For Workers (Ishchilar)
- See booking list in the "Bronlar" section
- Can view all existing appointments
- View focused on managing bookings

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Client View
1. Select "Mijozlar" on welcome page
2. Login as a client
3. Navigate to "Bronlar" section
4. See booking form

### Worker View
1. Select "Ishchilar" on welcome page
2. Login as a worker
3. Navigate to "Bronlar" section
4. See booking list

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits

1. **Role-Based Access**: Different views for different user types
2. **Improved UX**: Relevant content for each user role
3. **Security**: Workers can manage bookings, clients can create them
4. **Clarity**: Clear separation of functionality

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add worker-specific actions (confirm, cancel bookings)
2. Implement client booking history
3. Add admin role with full access
4. Include user profile management
5. Add role-specific notifications

The implementation ensures that clients and workers see the most relevant content for their role, improving the overall user experience.
