### 3. New Responsive Utilities

#### useMediaQuery Hook
A custom React hook for detecting screen size breakpoints:
```javascript
import useMediaQuery from './hooks/useMediaQuery';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const isMobile = useMediaQuery('(max-width: 768px)');
  
  return (
    <div>
      {isMobile ? <MobileView /> : <DesktopView />}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### useBreakpoints Hook
Predefined breakpoints for common screen sizes:
```javascript
import { useBreakpoints } from './hooks/useMediaQuery';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { isMobile, isTablet, isDesktop } = useBreakpoints();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {isMobile && <MobileContent />}
      {isTablet && <TabletContent />}
      {isDesktop && <DesktopContent />}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### ResponsiveContainer Component
A styled container component with responsive padding and max-width:
```javascript
import ResponsiveContainer from './components/ResponsiveContainer';

const MySection = () => (
  <ResponsiveContainer>
    <Content />
  </ResponsiveContainer>
);
```

#### ResponsiveGrid Component
A flexible grid component with responsive column control:
```javascript
import ResponsiveGrid from './components/ResponsiveGrid';

const MyGrid = () => (
  <ResponsiveGrid 
    columns={3} 
    gap="30px"
    mdColumns={2}
    smColumns={1}
  >
    <Item />
    <Item />
    <Item />
  </ResponsiveGrid>
);
```

## Breakpoints Used

The website uses the following standard breakpoints:

- **Extra Small (xs)**: Up to 575px
- **Small (sm)**: 576px to 767px
- **Medium (md)**: 768px to 991px
- **Large (lg)**: 992px to 1199px
- **Extra Large (xl)**: 1200px and above

## Performance Considerations

1. **Optimized Animations**: All animations use `transform` and `opacity` for better performance
2. **Efficient Media Queries**: Used `min-width` queries to avoid overlapping styles
3. **Touch-Friendly Elements**: Increased touch targets for mobile devices
4. **Reduced Motion**: Respects user's preference for reduced motion

## Accessibility Improvements

1. **Focus States**: Enhanced focus indicators for keyboard navigation
2. **Contrast Ratios**: Maintained WCAG AA compliance for text contrast
3. **Screen Reader Support**: Proper semantic HTML structure
4. **Responsive Text**: Fluid typography for better readability

## Testing

The responsive design has been tested on:
- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Tablet devices
- Various screen sizes using browser developer tools

## Future Improvements

1. Add progressive enhancement for JavaScript-disabled environments
2. Implement server-side rendering for better performance
3. Add more comprehensive accessibility testing
4. Optimize images for different screen densities
